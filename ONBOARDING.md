# Lucy Walker Jewelry — Client Portal Demo

Welcome to your Client Portal demo. This interactive dashboard shows what your Google Ads performance data looks like when presented in a live, always-on portal — instead of a static monthly PDF report.

---

## What This Is

This is a **working demo** built with sample data that mirrors a realistic luxury jewelry Google Ads account. It shows:

- Real-time KPI tracking (spend, clicks, conversions, ROAS)
- Campaign-level performance breakdown
- AI-generated insights that surface opportunities automatically
- A visual chart comparing spend vs revenue by campaign

Once connected to your live Google Ads account, this dashboard updates **daily** with real data.

## How to View the Demo

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
2. No login or internet connection required — it's a self-contained file

## Reading the Dashboard

### KPI Cards (Top Row)

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Total Spend** | How much was spent on Google Ads in the last 30 days |
| **Clicks** | Total ad clicks across all campaigns |
| **Conversions** | Completed purchases tracked from ads |
| **ROAS** | Return on Ad Spend — revenue generated per dollar spent (5.51x = $5.51 back for every $1 spent) |
| **Avg Order Value** | Average revenue per conversion ($2,127 for luxury jewelry) |
| **Cost / Conversion** | How much it costs to acquire one sale |

### Spend vs Revenue Chart

The bar chart compares what each campaign **costs** (navy bars) vs what it **earns** (orange bars). Bigger orange bars relative to navy bars = better performance. Brand search stands out with massive revenue relative to its small spend.

### AI Insights Panel

These insights are automatically generated based on your data. They highlight:
- Which campaigns are performing best (and why)
- Where there's room to scale budget profitably
- Cross-sell and bundling opportunities
- Areas that need optimization

### Campaign Performance Table

Full breakdown of every campaign with:
- **CTR** — Click-through rate (% of people who see your ad and click)
- **Conv. Rate** — % of clicks that become purchases
- **ROAS bars** — Visual comparison making it easy to spot top performers
